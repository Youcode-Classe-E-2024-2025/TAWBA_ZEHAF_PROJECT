## Kanban Board

The application now includes a Kanban board feature for each project. This allows users to:

- Visualize tasks in a board layout with columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Drag and drop tasks between columns to update their status
- Easily track the progress of tasks within a project

To access the Kanban board, navigate to a project's page and click on the "View Kanban Board" button.
